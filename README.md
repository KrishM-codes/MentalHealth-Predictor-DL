# MentalHealth-Predictor-DL

## 📌 Overview  
This project builds a **Deep Learning model** to predict mental health conditions based on **social media posts**. It collects data from Reddit, preprocesses it, and trains an LSTM-based classifier.

## 📂 Features  
- 📥 **Scrapes Reddit posts** from mental health-related subreddits  
- 🔄 **Preprocesses text data** (removes stopwords, tokenizes, lemmatizes)  
- 🧠 **Trains an LSTM model** for mental health classification  
- 📊 **Evaluates performance** using accuracy, loss plots, and classification reports  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **NLTK**, **TensorFlow/Keras**  
- **Reddit API (PRAW)** for data collection  
- **LSTM** for text classification  

## 🚀 Getting Started
